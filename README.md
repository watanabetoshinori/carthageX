# CarthageX

CarthageX is extension script for making Carthage (https://github.com/Carthage) more simplified.


## Installing Carthage X

1. Download `carthageX` file from github.
2. Move `carthageX` to your `PATH` directory. e.g. `/usr/local/bin/`
3. Change the permission of `carthageX` to make it executable:

	```sh
    chmod +x carthageX
    ```


## How to use

1. Move to your iOS project's directory.
2. Execute `init` command to create Cartfile.

	```sh
    carthageX init
    ```

3. Edit Cartfile.
4. Execute `update` command.

	```sh
    carthageX update
    ```

5. That's all! Now you can open the project by Xcode and start programming!


## Notice

At this time, carthageX supports iOS and WatchOS Project.
